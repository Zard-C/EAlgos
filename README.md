# Power Electronic Algos

This repo contains the implementation of various power electronic control algorithms. The algorithms shoubld be implemented in `Python` and `MATLAB`. The `Python` implementation is done using `NumPy` and `SciPy` libraries. The `MATLAB` implementation is done using the `Simulink` and `Simscape` libraries. But we will use `c` or `c++` for the final implementation and testing.

## Dependencies

1. `cmake`
2. `c/c++ compiler`
